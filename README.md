#Tiva BSP for TM4C123G
This is a basic BSP for TI Tiva C series microcontrollers with timer functions,
bidirectional buffered UART, and a simple command handling loop. It has been
written for the TM4C123GH6PM microcontroller, though it can be easily adapted
to other models in the Tiva C series family.
